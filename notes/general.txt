1. Prefer wrapper class return types rather than their primitives for method return types, since, they can hold `null`, but degrade performance due to object creation and memory usage
2. `record` keyword is used as a data-carrier class which allows a constructor to initialize all the fields at the time of object creation and all fields are final. reduces boilerplate code.
3. use-case of record like `public record Ticket` is when all fields are final and only getter() methods was the requirement.
4. suppose you have Cell[] cells. and in some constructor(size), doing cells = new Cell[size]. this ONLY initializes the cells array to be able to hold `size` cells. So, every cell object at every index is null. So, to initialize cell object at every index, run a loop to set cells[i] = new Cell(); otherwise, get NullPointerException. this applies to n-dimensional arrays
